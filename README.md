# NLP Word Embedding using Word2Vec

This project demonstrates how to generate word embeddings using the Word2Vec technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 📌 Objective
To convert textual data into meaningful numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic relationships between words.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Tokenization
- Text preprocessing
- Word2Vec model
- Vector representation of words
- Similarity between words

## 📂 Project Structure
- `NLP_word_embedding.ipynb` — Complete implementation notebook

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- gensim
- nltk
- matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required libraries from `requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially

## 📈 Outcome
The model learns vector representations where semantically similar words are closer in vector space.
